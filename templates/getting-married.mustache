    <h1>Yep, we're getting married...</h1>

    <p>By booting up your terminal and logging on to this information repository you should be able to find everything you need to help us celebrate our marriage by navigating through the archives.</p>

    <p>
        We would be delighted if you, our families and fellow Rebel Alliance cohorts could join us on <strong><time>Saturday 16 November 2013</time></strong> to (choose your own adventure):
        <ol>
            <li>in our union to create the ultimate zombie fighting team</li>
            <li>to help celebrate the greatest friendship since Han Solo and Chewbacca (you can decide who is who)</li>
            <li>to commemorate the most kick-ass union since Buffy and slaying</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>

    <p>Instead of having an official photographer we are asking all of our lovely friends and family to take as many photos as desier on one of your numerous personal devices. If you would like to share them publicly please feel free to upload them or email them directly to us at <a href="mailto:kevinandria@gmail.com">kevinandria@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Gifts</h2>

    <p>As we are lucky to already have our headquarters up and running we have decided not to request wedding gifts. However, if you would like to mark the occasion with a gift we would very much appreciate a small contribution towards building our very own DeathStar. If you would like to contribute we will have an area for anonymous donations and cards on the day.</p>

    <p>More than anything we hope that you can make it on the day so please do not feel obliged to give in any way.</p>

    <p>Unless it is a kitten. All kittens will be appreciated. Especially ginger ones.</p>
