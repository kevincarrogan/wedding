            <p>
                We would be delighted if you, our families and fellow Rebel Alliance cohorts could join us on <strong><time>Saturday 16 November 2013</time></strong> to (choose your own adventure):
                <ol>
                    <li>in our union to create the ultimate zombie fighting team</li>
                    <li>to help celebrate the greatest friendship since Han Solo and Chewbacca (you can decide who is who)</li>
                    <li>to commemorate the most kick-ass union since Buffy and slaying</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Join us!</h2>
            <p>Please RSVP your attendance for our happy-happy-joy-joy day by emailing us at kevinandria@gmail.com or calling Ria on 077089295830. Please include the names of all attendees, including sidekicks and padawans and any specific dietary requirements e.g. only blue milk.</p>

            <p>Everyone is invited to both the service and reception but if you do think you might get trapped in a trash compactor, need to defeat a zombie horde or get delayed by the gorram Alliance and can only attend the reception, please let us now.</p>

            <h2>The Shindig</h2>
            <p>The blessing and reception will be held at the same venue. Please arrive at <strong><time>2.30pm</time></strong> (Standard Earth GMT) prompt for a quick Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster before the ceremony.</p>

            <p>The blessing will start at <strong><time>3pm</time></strong> and will be officiated by Grand Moff Dollar-Smirnoff (chosen purely because he has a kickass name). He will require the utmost respect and may demand to know the location of the sambuca. Under no circumstances must you reveal the location, even upon threat of the destruction of East London (although at least we'd be rid of most of the Earth's population of hipsters).</p>

            <p>Food and drink will be provided throughout so please let us know any dietary requirements when you RSVP</p>

            <p>Once everyone's places are clean the games wil begin. Rock Band and various board games will be available to choose and play if you wish.</p>

            <h2>Costume</h2>

            <p>The most important part of our day is that we celebrate it with the ones we love. To make sure everyone is comfortable, including us, we'd like everyone to know that there is <em>no dress code</em>. Please feel free to come smart, casual, as your favourite superhero or clad in battle armour. The only attire not allowed is that of mimes of clowns; evil buggers.</p>

            <h2>Photography</h2>

            <p>Instead of having an official photographer we are asking all of our lovely friends and family to take as many photos as desier on one of your numerous personal devices. If you would like to share them publicly please feel free to upload them or email them directly to us at <a href="mailto:kevinandria@gmail.com">kevinandria@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Gifts</h2>

            <p>As we are lucky to already have our headquarters up and running we have decided not to request wedding gifts. However, if you would like to mark the occasion with a gift we would very much appreciate a small contribution towards building our very own DeathStar. If you would like to contribute we will have an area for anonymous donations and cards on the day.</p>

            <p>More than anything we hope that you can make it on the day so please do not feel obliged to give in any way.</p>

            <p>Unless it is a kitten. All kittens will be appreciated. Especially ginger ones.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
